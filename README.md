# Weather_Recognition_ResNet34
Weather recognition is a classification computer vision project which use ResNet34 backbone and 50 epochs to forecast the weather

Takes 30-40 minutes when trained in Google Colaboratory

# Dataset 
Weather dataset (link to download in the code file) which has 6862 pictures (samples) for 11 kinds of weather (dew, fogsmog, frost, glaze, hail, lightning, rain, rainbow, rime, sandstorm, snow)
